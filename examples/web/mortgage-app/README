This directory contains the RDC based JSPs for the mortgage sample
application.

The starting point for this application is:
./login.jsp

The sample application uses the following fictitious scenario for getting 
quotes/setting up a home mortgage:
1) Login - Asks user for a member number and the MLS number of
   the property of interest.
2) Mortgage details - After prompting the user with the value of the
   property specified by the MLS number, the user is asked to provide
   details for the type of mortgage, and percentage down payment.
3) Quote - The user is provided with a quote, and the choice to accept
   or reject it.

This sample application only provides placeholders for the property value
and the quote without using any backend. This also means the user may 
provide any member number or MLS number between 2 and 9 digits long.
